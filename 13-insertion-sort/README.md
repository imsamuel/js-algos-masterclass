# Insertion Sort

## What is insertion sort?

The insertion sort algorithm builds up the sort by gradually creating a larger left half which is always sorted.

## What is the runtime of insertion sort?

O(_n_^2).

## When may insertion sort be useful?

It has a fast best-case running time and is a good sorting algorithm to use if the input list is already sorted.

Therefore, the insertion sort algorithm may be applied when data is coming in live/streaming, and you need to insert it in moment's notice.
