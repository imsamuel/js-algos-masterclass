# Introduction to Sorting

## What is sorting?

Sorting is the process of rearranging the items in a collection (e.g. an array) so that the items are in some kind of order.

For example:

- Sorting numbers from smallest to largest
- Sorting names alphabetically
- Sorting movies based on release year
- Sorting movies based on revenue

## Why learn how to sort?

Sorting is an incredibly common task, so it's good to know how it works.

Also, there are many different ways to sort things, and different techniques have their own advantages and disadvantages.

## What is bubble sort?

Bubble sort, sometimes referred to as sinking sort, is a simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly sorts through the list, compares adjecent elements and swaps them if they are in the wrong place.

## What's the runtime of a bubble sort?

It has a worst-case running time of O(_n_^2), and can only run in its best-case running time of O(_n_) - provided that the implementation of the bubble sort algorithm has already been optimized (stopping the scanning of the array's elements once it is already sorted).
