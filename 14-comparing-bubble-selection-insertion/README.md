# Comparing bubble, selection, and insertion sort

**Comparison**

In both selection and bubble sort, the comparison is always **among** the unsorted elements. In insertion sort, the comparison is **between** the unsorted and sorted elements.

**Swapping vs Shifting**

In both selection and bubble sorts, we **swap** the unsorted elements to create the sorted list. In insertion sort, we **shift** the unsorted elements to create the sorted list.

**Stability of the sorted list (assuming non-identical elements)**

In both selection sort and bubble sort, the sorted list is stable. Once an element is sorted, its position does not change. In insertion sort, the sorted list is unstable. The position of the sorted elements can change.
