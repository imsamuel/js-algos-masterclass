# Radix Sort

## What is Radix Sort?

Radix sort is a sorting algorithm that:

- only works on lists of numbers
- never makes comparisons between elements

## How does Radix Sort work?

It exploits the fact that information about the size of a number is encoded in the number of digits - the more digits a number has the bigger it is.
