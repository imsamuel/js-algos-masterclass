# Linear Search

## What's a linear search?

It is a method for finding a target value within a array. It **sequentially** checks each element of the list until a match is found or the whole list has been searched.

## What's the runtime of a linear search?

O(_n_). A linear search runs in at worst **linear** time and makes at most _n_ comparisons, where _n_ is the length of the list.

## When can a linear search algorithm be applied?

It is most applicable to a collection of **unsorted** data.
